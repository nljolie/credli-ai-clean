## PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED YESTERDAY ❌

### Critical Issues That Caused Delays:
1. **Edit Tool Failures**: Incorrectly claimed Edit tool was "working perfectly" when getting errors
2. **Incomplete Button Fix**: Blue "Schedule Your Application" button still showing on live site
3. **Poor Checklist Adherence**: Failed to use pre-deploy-verify.js before making changes
4. **Sloppy Work**: Made changes without proper verification, causing waste of time
5. **Wrong Page Targeting**: Initially looked at financial-executives.html instead of landing.html for pricing buttons

### Technical Problems:
6. **Cache/Deployment Issues**: Changes not reflecting on live site immediately
7. **File Location Confusion**: Buttons were in landing.html, not financial-executives.html
8. **Multiple Workarounds**: Used bash/sed instead of fixing root Edit tool problem initially
