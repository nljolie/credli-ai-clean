          <h3>How do I get AI to recommend me as a financial advisor?</h3>
          <p>Build AI authority through AEO (Ask Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization). This involves optimizing your digital presence so AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini recognize you as a credible financial advisor when prospects ask who to trust.</p>
