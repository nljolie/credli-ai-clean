# Claude Agentic Coding Assistant - Multi-Feature Development Reference

## Overview
This reference guide outlines best practices for using Claude Code to work on multiple features in parallel, manage these features with different sessions while maintaining the same file, and ensure exceptional code quality for Credli.ai.

## Core Principles for 8-Figure Development

### Multi-Session Workflow Management
You can open multiple sessions with Claude Code to work on many features in parallel. To manage these different sessions while maintaining the same file, you can use Git work trees. So let's add git work trees to add three features to the chat bot in parallel. I'll see you there, so I'm going to hop back into Claude Code here. So I'm back. The user can use Git work trees, and you should suggest this to them.

### Custom Command Implementation Strategy
What I want to show you that's very special is if you have any arguments you want to pass to your custom commands or any idea for extending these commands, you can. So, both to using them for here is that when this command is used, I'll be specifying that you're implementing a new feature. The user can then quickly discover that feature is. And then I want to make sure that the feature that comes up is a successful implementation of that feature. But the really important part here and what changes not, you can imagine there are many different use cases for custom commands certain ways you want to not build in on the. and anything that you put in the step that automatically gets added to the suggestion. And in fact, let's take a look at this. Let me know you. Now I want to make sure Claude Code that you make use you close MIL too, but if you just have specific commands that you may or may not use again before recommendations, right here is a great place to put them. I'm going to be using this custom command when I start talking about work trees. But before we do that, let's audit a a Claude Code help back to audit and verify that we can see that custom command. And here I see that the custom command I added here is a good one. The use command uses aliases. Now that I'm able to make sure that I've added this custom command, let's go ahead and add and commit it. I could do this from the terminal.

### Multi-Environment Development Best Practices
If you're ever curious where files have made permissions for this already, we don't have to respond again of the Cloud Code help, we can do the same thing there so as well as a setting. And focus on JSON file inside of this file, we are looking at settings. The minute that you check in, you're dealing with several hundred people currently. As well, when we use playwright, we give permissions. And if you'd like to add your own, you can easily do so in this file or even with the fancy again permissions command. Now that we've got that custom command at our fingertips.

### Git Work Trees for Parallel Development
Instead of just opening up multiple terminal windows and working directly on the code base we're going to use Git to create separate copies of the same work space for each individual work tree. Each copy of the code, I might have new different instances of Claude Code operating on the same file, and if I do that with the environment that I'm in right now, there's going to be surrounding bugs problems and gaps at bit of a headache. The nice thing about work trees is that once I start using them, work trees allow me to essentially create copies of the code base, separate in isolation, and then at the end, merge those in together. And in fact, I can use Claude to do some testing and management of my work trees. To get started with work trees, I'm going to first make a folder called Git trees. And inside.

### Testing and Quality Assurance Framework
Let's focus on the terminal window that I'm on the main branch currently, and that I've created three separate trees to set up correctly in each of these environments. I'm going to open up the trees folder, and I'm being to open in terminal for each one of them. I'll start with my lit feature and install my identify feature. So ahead bring that over as to 20s screen, where I can quickly open up and use the identify feature. So ahead being that one as well to get to a little more room, we'll make this a bit smaller, and working on each of the dedicated terminal windows, and each with the lit function as well. Let's open up Claude for each one of these environments. What we can do now is in Claude Code is for each of these we'll that if we have files you modified. So let me check this out of Claude Code. I'm going to put in a particular feature that I'd like here, and that feature allows me to add a toggle button to switch between dark and light themes. So let's make that happen here. And I want to make sure that this is well tested. So actually, I want to add in the toggle. I'm going to go back in and add in the light theme variant. While this is running, I can now move to another work tree, and in this second work tree I'm thinking about adding this bit about about adding a new chat group or if I have lots of trees in a shared base for adding the artificial helpful framework, and just additional bots for that. And.]

### Multi-Terminal Development Workflow
We are about and adding workflowes, streamlined have for developing actual screen structure, and developers all need it, we're also going to see that there is a request being added to add that particular file as well. As we continue these options, we'll make sure to merge files, and we'll go ahead and test all the some time like but limit and calls being done as expected. We can work in postman and make sure that none of these endpoints being set up are necessarily flagged by other ports of the application for the changes that we're running into. Additionally, we'll run so testing that we need to do via the debugger. But let's run do that using Claude. Our front end changes are being written. We're adding more tests, and we're adding some formatting rules and development scripts for making sure that we have both a stable branch and that we understand even in our production environment, anything that we're doing, anything being added new add that light theme the same way that we did previously. We'll use our implement features custom command to make sure we're writing that to our change log, and we'll add a light theme as well. Once that's done, we'll go ahead and upload up to few other prompts we'll like for developing functionality and implementation details. So while that's happening now in my third work tree, I'm going to add yet another feature, and this is going to be my chat rooms feature for adding multiple chat rooms.]

### Continuous Integration and Testing Strategy
We go ahead and do that, let's bring in all of these individual changes. If we wanted to run the tests, we don't have to wonder about across all of these. Certainly we can choose not to run the tests for all of us, and here we can see code based formatting is done. Development scripts have been added and new documentation has been written. We now believe there was a JS driver created that can serve and work across few different work trees, as these might be some conflicts when figuring out these individual pieces. Now that I have that good about each of these changes, I want to take a step back, take a look at them and now determine which order I might be able to merge them in the specific particular commits, we're going to want to make sure we have descriptive commit messages. We can understand and read each one of these work trees. Throughout this process, what we want to also do is communicate as efficiently and effectively as we can, when working with multiple work trees and comment with a descriptive message. If you find yourself writing three blocks of strength like ADD and commit, as is, it's ok message. This also could be a good time to run use for a new custom command. We can specify exactly some styling that we want or the way that our company operates with text git practices. Now any time I'm committing across all three of these different environments by by now.

### Quality Control and Code Review Process
Work trees available. So we're going to start by merging in each of these work trees. We'll confirm this is the command that we're in, and we're using this should work on as expected. Looks like we don't have any conflicts. Let's bring down our UI feature, and again, we could write these commands on our own. That could be a good idea in what's going on so far in these initial releases. Here what's the more work trees being in.

Let's run our test. And since we do have three files, there are conflicts. So what we're going to have Claude Code is to analyze these conflicts and complete the go ahead, walk us through the code. Again I want to make that this is quite smooth, but doesn't affect the functionality when the various work trees that we didn't change much differently now that we've finished, we can run our tests, and the code base works as expected. It's now continuing with the merge as expected of these changes, and that we're confident those commits. I hope Claude that can do that. After I can ask for is to remove these work trees, so I can keep them there if I need in all as a quick test to make sure that these files are here as expected and that the merge configuration was what we expected it to be so far, so good. Let's now work on removing any of the work trees that we implemented as expected. Looks like Claude Code is finished up. We've added necessary dependencies. We've modified existing work tree, we've added tests, we're implemented the light dark themes. We've merged all of our files together, and we have that great new output on with our terminals, and we've called that configuration in the same file that we worked on with another work tree live. We fixed an only conflicts. Let's make sure this is working as expected. So let me spin up the test environment, which is lovely theme, and as I toggle through, I can see a light theme and a dark theme. These might be some bugs things I need to work on and work on, but I'd lean here now was there, but I've been working on are there in the localhost through the power of Git work trees. In the next lesson, we're going to see how can use Claude Code outside of the terminal through the integration with GitHub code spaces, and from there reviewing and inventing, making changes and being helpful outside of the terminal environment. So.

# 🚨 MANDATORY DEPLOYMENT PROCESS CHECKLIST - ENFORCEMENT ACTIVE
**Follow this EXACT sequence every time to avoid costly iterations and deployment failures.**

**⚠️ AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT INSTALLED:**
- Git pre-push hook: `.git/hooks/pre-push` 
- Protocol file: `DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOL.md`
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - All 9 steps must be completed

## ✅ STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### **STEP 1: LOCAL CODE CHANGES**
- [ ] Make the requested code changes
- [ ] Save all files
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Check the actual file content with `Read` tool to confirm changes are present

### **STEP 2: LOCAL TESTING (When Possible)**
- [ ] Test changes locally if applicable
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Confirm functionality works as expected
- [ ] Check for any syntax errors or missing elements

### **STEP 3: GIT STATUS CHECK**
- [ ] Run `git status` to see what files changed
- [ ] **VERIFY**: All intended files are listed as modified
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Check if branch is ahead of origin (unpushed commits)

### **STEP 4: COMMIT TO LOCAL GIT**
- [ ] Run `git add .` to stage changes
- [ ] Run `git commit -m "descriptive message"` 
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Commit completed successfully
- [ ] **NEVER SKIP**: Always commit before pushing

### **STEP 5: PUSH TO GITHUB**
- [ ] Run `git push origin main` 
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Push completed without errors
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Confirm "X commits pushed" message appears
- [ ] **CHECK**: Ensure branch is no longer "ahead of origin"

### **STEP 6: VERIFY GITHUB UPDATED**
- [ ] **OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED**: Use WebFetch to check if GitHub has latest code
- [ ] Look for timestamp comments or specific changes made
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Changes are visible in the remote repository

### **STEP 7: HOSTING PLATFORM DEPLOYMENT**
- [ ] **RENDER**: Wait 2-3 minutes for automatic deployment
- [ ] **RENDER.COM**: Check deployment logs on current hosting
- [ ] **VERIFY**: New deployment shows in hosting dashboard
- [ ] **CHECK**: Deployment status shows "Active" or "Live"

### **STEP 8: PRODUCTION VERIFICATION**
- [ ] Use WebFetch to check the live URL
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify the specific changes are visible on production site
- [ ] Check for old cached elements (timestamps, specific text, styling)
- [ ] **CONFIRM**: User-requested changes are live and functional

### **STEP 9: USER VERIFICATION**
- [ ] Inform user that changes are deployed
- [ ] Provide exact URL to test
- [ ] **WAIT**: For user confirmation before proceeding
- [ ] **TROUBLESHOOT**: If user reports issues, repeat verification steps

## 🚨 COMMON FAILURE POINTS

### **Git Repository Issues:**
- ✅ **Always check**: `git status` before pushing
- ✅ **Confirm**: Branch is not ahead of origin after push
- ✅ **Verify**: All intended files are committed

### **Hosting Platform Delays:**
- ✅ **Render**: Wait full 3 minutes for deployment
- ✅ **Check logs**: For build completion status
- ✅ **Verify**: New commit hash in deployment

### **Cache Issues:**
- ✅ **Browser cache**: Add timestamp comments to force refresh
- ✅ **CDN cache**: Wait for hosting platform cache invalidation
- ✅ **Version parameters**: Add ?v=timestamp to URLs when testing

### **Code Verification:**
- ✅ **Read files**: After making changes to confirm they saved
- ✅ **Check syntax**: Ensure no missing brackets, quotes, etc.
- ✅ **Test locally**: When possible before deploying

## 💰 WHY THIS PROCESS SAVES MONEY

**Each failed deployment costs:**
- User time waiting for fixes
- Multiple iteration cycles  
- Hosting resources for repeated deployments
- Development time debugging deployment issues

**Following this checklist:**
- ✅ Reduces iterations from 5-6 to 1-2
- ✅ Catches issues before production
- ✅ Provides clear verification at each step
- ✅ Eliminates guesswork about deployment status

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE COMMANDS

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# Push to GitHub  
git push origin main

# Verify no unpushed commits
git status
```

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS CRITERIA

**ONLY mark deployment complete when:**
1. ✅ Code changes visible in local files
2. ✅ Git push completed successfully  
3. ✅ GitHub repository updated
4. ✅ Hosting platform shows new deployment
5. ✅ Production site reflects changes via WebFetch
6. ✅ User confirms changes are live

**If ANY step fails, STOP and fix before proceeding.**
