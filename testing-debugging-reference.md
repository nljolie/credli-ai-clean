# Testing, Error Debugging & Code Refactoring Reference
## Credli.ai Development Quality Assurance Guide

**Created**: August 20, 2025  
**Based on**: Lesson 01 - Testing Error Debugging and Code Refactoring  
**Purpose**: Methodical approach to code quality assurance and debugging

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Tests First, Fixes Second

Instead of copying errors and hoping for solutions, use a **methodical approach**:

1. **Write comprehensive tests FIRST**
2. **Run tests to identify specific failures**  
3. **Fix issues based on test results**
4. **Build robust foundation for future development**

---

## üìã Pre-Debugging Checklist

When encountering errors in the Credli.ai codebase:

### ‚úÖ Before You Debug
- [ ] **Document the error** - Don't just copy/paste into Claude
- [ ] **Identify affected components** - Which files could be causing issues?
- [ ] **Enable Extended Thinking** - Use `think a lot` for complex problems
- [ ] **Enable Plan Mode** - Get comprehensive plan before implementation
- [ ] **Prepare test infrastructure** - Set up proper testing framework

### ‚úÖ Key Files to Test (Adapt for Credli.ai)
- [ ] **Core functionality files** (landing.html, index.html)
- [ ] **CSS/Styling systems** (landing-styles.css)
- [ ] **JavaScript interactions** (if any)
- [ ] **Configuration files** (any JSON/config files)
- [ ] **Legal document integrity** (all 11 legal pages)

---

## üîß Testing Framework Setup

### For Web Applications (Credli.ai Context)

```bash
# Install testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev jest puppeteer
# OR for Python-based testing
pip install pytest pytest-mock
```

### Basic Test Structure Template

```javascript
// tests/credli-functionality.test.js
describe('Credli.ai Core Functionality', () => {
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });
  
  test('Landing page loads correctly', async () => {
    // Test landing page functionality
  });
  
  test('Legal footer links work', async () => {
    // Test all 11 legal document links
  });
  
  test('Cred Score calculator functions', async () => {
    // Test core credibility scoring
  });
  
});
```

---

## üêõ Debugging Methodology

### Step 1: Comprehensive Test Creation
```markdown
**Prompt Template for Claude:**

"I need you to write comprehensive tests for these specific files in my Credli.ai project:
- /landing.html (main landing page functionality)  
- /landing-styles.css (styling integrity)
- /index.html (Cred Score calculator)
- [List other relevant files]

Please write tests that verify:
1. All links work correctly
2. Forms submit properly  
3. Legal footer displays on all pages
4. Responsive design functions
5. JavaScript calculations work

Use [testing framework] and create proper fixtures and mocks."
```

### Step 2: Test Execution & Analysis
- Run all tests systematically
- Identify specific failure points
- Document which components are failing
- Prioritize critical path issues first

### Step 3: Methodical Fixes
- Fix one issue at a time
- Re-run tests after each fix
- Verify no regression in other components
- Update tests as needed

## üîÑ Refactoring Best Practices

### When to Refactor
- **Adding new functionality** (like multi-step Cred Score analysis)
- **Improving user experience** (better form handling)
- **Scaling for growth** (more legal documents, features)
- **Performance optimization** (faster page loads)

### Refactoring Approach Template

```markdown
**Claude Prompt for Refactoring:**

"I need to refactor [specific component] in my Credli.ai project.

**Current Behavior**: [Describe current functionality]
**Desired Behavior**: [Describe what you want]
**Requirements**: 
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Don't break existing legal compliance
- Keep all 11 legal documents accessible
- Preserve AI Trust Consultant branding

**Example Flow**: [Provide specific example]

Please create multiple refactoring options using sub-agents, then provide detailed implementation plan."
```

### Multi-Agent Approach
- Use **sub-agents** for complex refactoring decisions
- **Dispatch parallel agents** to brainstorm different approaches
- **Compare options** before implementing
- **Choose based on maintainability** and project requirements

## üö® Critical Error Patterns to Watch

### Configuration Issues
```bash
# Example: Check for zero/null values
max_results = 0  # This breaks search functionality
```

### Missing Dependencies
- Legal document links broken
- CSS files not loading
- JavaScript errors in console

### Content Errors
- Fabricated statistics without citations
- Incorrect effective dates
- Missing legal disclaimers
- Broken collaborative messaging

## üìä Test Running Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test
# OR
pytest

# Run specific test categories
npm test -- --grep "legal documents"
pytest -k "compliance"
